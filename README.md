# javascript-helpers
Misc javascript files for inclusion in personal projects.
Some may find themselves in their own repositories on reaching utility sufficiency.

### timers.js
Create nested timers that pause on _another's_ pause somewhere up the parent chain.  Also an experiment in defineProperty usage.

### itertools.js
Mirror python's itertools module's functionaility in javascript.  An experiment in javascript's yield statements.

### helpers.js
Helper functions used for typing brevity and general convenience, a number of which are experimental, untested, or unfinished.

### drag.js
A simple (enough) means of tracking mouse-drag behavior on an object.  An old experiment, refined over time and use.  Also commits the sin of extending the DOM.
